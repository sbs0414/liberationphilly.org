Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork this repository and submit a pull request if you'd like any changes to be made. Please keep a few things in mind:

1. This repo is being used as a learning tool for activists who are new beginners to web development. Because of this, we are trying to keep it as simple as possible. The site should be able to run directly inside of Chrome without any additional software.
2. We're committed to keeping this repo open-source, and ask that there are no dependencies on proprietary software.

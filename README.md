Website for Direct Action Everywhere Philadelphia. This repo is the front-end code, while some dynamic functionality is powered by [dxephilly-api](https://github.com/directactioneverywhere/dxephilly-api).

Local Development

This site runs on a very simple Node.js app server using [Express](http://expressjs.com/) with [Harp](http://harpjs.com/) as middleware. Install Node.js and use `node server.js` to start the server.

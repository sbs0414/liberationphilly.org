Website for Liberation Philadelphia.

Local Development
-----------------
This site runs on a very simple Node.js app server using [Express](http://expressjs.com/) with Wick as middleware to support Nunjucks templating. Install Node.js and run `npm install` in the directory initially, then use `npm run start` to start the server.
